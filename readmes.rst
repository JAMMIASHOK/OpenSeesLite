 OpenSeesLite
==============

This is a light version of OpenSees with only C++ and a main function in ``OpenSees/main``.

Type ``make`` in ``OpenSees/main`` and will generate an executable ``OpenSeesMain``.

Change the ``OpenSees/Makefile.def`` for your system.

Change the ``OpenSees/main/OpenSeesMain.cpp`` for building models in C++.
